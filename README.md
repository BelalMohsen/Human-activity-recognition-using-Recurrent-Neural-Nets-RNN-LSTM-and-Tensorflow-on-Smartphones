# Human activity recognition using Recurrent Neural Nets(RNN), LSTM and Tensorflow on Smartphones
This was my Master's project where i was involved using a dataset from Wireless Sensor Data Mining Lab (WISDM) to build a machine learning model to predict basic human activities using a smartphone accelerometer, Using Tensorflow API, recurrent neural nets and multiple stacks of Long-short-term memory units(LSTM)  for building a deep network with hidden units.  After the model was trained,  it was saved and exported to an android application and the predictions were made using the model as proof of concept and the interface UI to speak out the results using text-to-speech API.
